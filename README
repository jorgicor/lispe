Compiling
=========

Getting the code from revision control
--------------------------------------

If you cloned the project from a revision control system (i.e. GitHub), you
will need first to use the GNU autotools to generate some files, in particular,
the `configure` script. Use:

    $ ./bootstrap

to generate the required files. You will need *GNU autoconf* and *GNU
automake*.


Compiling from the source distribution
--------------------------------------

After having bootstrapped the project, and if you are building on a Unix
environment (this includes *Cygwin* on *Windows*), you can find detailed
instructions in the file `INSTALL`.

Normally, after installing from source, you can find this on your system:

~~~
/usr/local/bin/lispe                    The program executable.
/usr/local/share/doc/lispe/COPYING      License.
/usr/local/share/doc/lispe/README       This file.
/usr/local/share/doc/lispe/NEWS         What's new in this version.
/usr/local/share/doc/lispe/INSTALL      How to compile, install and uninstall.
/usr/local/share/doc/lispe/AUTHORS      Authors.
/usr/local/share/lispe/init.scm         File with base Scheme definitions.
~~~

If you are installing the program using your OS distribution package system,
these folders will probably be different.  Try changing `/usr/local` to
`/usr`.

Hacking
=======

If you don't want to install the program and only want to play with it, you
can run `./configure && make` and run the program from the `src` folder.

Note however that the program first tries to load a file named `init.scm` with
Scheme definitions from the current directory; if not found, it will try to
load it from `/usr/local/share/lispe/init.scm` (or an equivalent path). This
file is in the folder `data/` on the source tree, so remember to copy it to
wherever you run `lispe` to be able to load it.
