Compiling
=========

Getting the code from revision control
--------------------------------------

If you cloned the project from a revision control system (i.e. GitHub), you
will need first to use the GNU autotools to generate some files, in particular,
the `configure` script. Use:

    $ ./bootstrap

to generate the required files. You will need *GNU autoconf* and *GNU
automake*.
